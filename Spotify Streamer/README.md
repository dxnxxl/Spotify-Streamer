# Final Project

## By Gavin Taskey, Daniel Spencer, Luke Betts, and Luis Pulido

This project was built with IntelliJ IDEA.

We suppressed the warnings in each of the four Search classes because of the possibility of the class being used outside of the current package.

We suppressed the warnings in the Song class for future acquisition of private variables.

We suppressed the warning in the UI class because of the requirement of having these arguments in order for data to be displayed.
